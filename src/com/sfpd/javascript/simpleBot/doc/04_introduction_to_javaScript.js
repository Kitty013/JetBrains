/**
$1. What is JavaScript
    JavaScript is one of the most used programming languages. It is used for both
    front-end and back-end development.
    JavaScript is based on the ECMASScript standard. The latest version of this
    standard is ES11.

$2. The first program
    Programs written in this language are called **scripts**.
    Here is an example of a simple JS script that prints "I am starting to learn
    javaScript."
**/
console.log("I am starting to learn JavaScript!");
