    /*  You have just started a sales job in a department store. Your pay consists of a base salary and a commission.
        The base salary is $5000. The scheme shown below is used to determine the commission rate.
                Sales Amount                Commission Rate
                $ 0.01 - $ 5000              6 percent
                $ 5000 - $ 10000             8 percent
                $ 10000 and above           10 percent
        Note that this is a graduated rate. The rate for the first $ 5000 is at 6 %, the next $ 5000 is at 8 %, and the
        rest is at 10 %. If your sales amounts to $25000, the commission is 5000 * 6% + 5000 * 8% + 15000 * 10% = 2200.
        Your goal is to earn $ 30000 in a year. Write a program to find the minimum sales you have to generate is order
        to make $ 30000.
