     *              javac Main.java
     *          The javac command asks the compiler to translate the source code
     *          into bytecode. The result is the file named Main.class

     *          the same directory as your source file)
     *              java -cp . Main
     *          The java command starts a Java application. It does this by starting
     *          a JRE and invoking the main method inside the Main class.
     *          The -cp parameter (classpath) specifies the location of user-
     *          defined classes and packages. The dot . means the current terminal
     *          directory.
