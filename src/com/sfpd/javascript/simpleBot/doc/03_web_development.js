$1. Frontend and backend development
    Frontend development also called client-side programming, is the development of the
    user interface as well as writing the logic of interaction with users. It's
    responsible for everything users see when they open a web page and everything they
    interact with.
    Backend development, also called server-side programming, is the development of the
    internal server side of the web application, the implementation of its logic. It
    includes the things that users do not see, and what happens outside of their
    browser and computer.

$2. Developers
    Frontend developers: make web pages according to the layout received from the
    designer. They are responsible for the correct functioning and display of websites
    in different browsers and on different devices.
    Backend developers: write the basic business logic of an application, process user
    data, organize information storage in databases, implement data security and
    protection, optimize applications for maximum speed and scalability.
    Full-stack developers: are involved in all phases of web application development.
    From the creation of the client part to the implementation of the server part.

$3. Separation of client and servers parts
    - we can independently replace the frontend and backend logic, minimizing the
      number of errors
    - we need a server to store and structure data
    - data on the client's side may become outdated, but the server's answer are
      usually up-to-date
    - it's easier to manage data flows and orchestrate processes on a few servers
      than on millions of clients
    - some tasks don't need an update from a server, it's faster to perform them
      locally

$4. How do frontend and backend communicate
    This happens through HTTP requests:
    1. The client sends a request to the server to retrieve of modify data using the
       HTTP protocol.
    2. Backend processes this request and returns the response via HTTP.
    3. Frontend receives the response and processes it, and then displays the result
       to the user.

    The most popular format for exchanging data between client and server is JSON.
    The most common used markup languages are HTML and XML
