# Increment And Decrement Operators
The operators +, -, *, /, and % can be combined with the assignment operator to form
augmented operators.

| OPERATOR | 	NAME	          | DESCRIPTION	                        | EXAMPLE            |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------|
| ++var	   | Pre-increment	  | Increment var by 1, and use the     | int j = ++i;       |
|          |                 | new var value in the statement      | ==> j is 2, i is 2 |
| Var++	   | Post increment	 | Increment var by 1, but use the     | int j = i++;       |
|          |                 | original var value in the statement | ==> j is 1, i is 2 |
| --var	   | Pre decrement	  | Decrement var by 1, and use the     | int j = --i;       |
|          |                 | new var value in the statement      | ==> j = 0, i is 0  |
| Var--	   | Post decrement  | Decrement var by 1, and use the     | int j = i--        |
|          |                 | original var value in the statement | ==> j = 1, i = 0   |
