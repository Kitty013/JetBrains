# What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data.
They have the following major hardware components:
   * A central processing unit (CPU)
   * Memory (main memory)
   * Storage devices (disk and CD)
   * Input devices (mouse, keyboard)
   * Output devices (monitors and printers)
   * Communication devices (modems and network interface cards)

## central processing unit
It retrieves instructions from the memory and executes them. <br>
2 components:
* control unit: controls and coordinates the actions of the other components
* arithmetic/logic unit: performs numeric operations and logical operations


## bits and bytes
A computer is really nothing more than a series of switches. Each switch exits in two
states: on or off. Storing information in a computer is simply a matter of setting a
sequence of switches on or off. If the switch is on, its value is 1. If the switch is
off, its value is O. They are called bits. <br>
The minimum storage unit is a computer is a byte. A byte is composed of eight bits.

## memory
You can think of memory as the computer's work area for executing a program. A program 
and its data must be moved into the computer's memory before they can be executed by
the CPU.

## storage devices
There are three main types of storage devices:
* Magnetic disk drives
* Optical disc drives (CD and DVD)
* Universal serial bus (USB) flash drives

## input and output devices
* The Keyboard is a device for entering input.
* The Mouse is a pointing device.
* The monitor displays information (text and graphics).

## communication devices
* A dial-up modem uses a phone line to dial a phone number to connect to the Internet 
  and can transfer data at a speed up to 56,000 bps (bits per second).
* A digital subscriber line (DSL) connection also uses a standard phone line, but it
  can transfer data 20 times faster than a standard dial-up modem.
* A cable modem uses the cable line maintained by the cable company and is generally 
  faster than DSL.
* A network interface card (NIC) is a device that connects a computer to a local area
  network (LAN).
* Wireless networking is now extremely popular in homes, businesses, and schools. Every
  laptop computer sold today is equipped with a wireless adapter that enables the
  computer to connect to the LAN and the Internet.
