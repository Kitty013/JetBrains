# Programming Language
## machine language
The machine language - a set of built-in primitive instructions. They are in the form of
binary code, so if you want to give a computer an instruction in its native language,
you have to enter the instruction as binary code.

## assembly language
Assembly language was created in the early days of computing as an alternative to
machine languages.
