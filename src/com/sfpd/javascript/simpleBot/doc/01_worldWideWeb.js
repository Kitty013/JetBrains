/**
$1. What is the Web?
    The **World Wide Web** is a collection of information resources scattered around the
    world and linked together by reference.
    A unit of hypertext data on the W3 is called a **web page**. A web page may contain text,
    media files, graphics and links to other pages.
    A group of Web pages that share a common content theme, design and links to each
    other is called a **website**. Special programs - browsers - are used to download
    and browse these websites.

$2. Difference between WWW and internet.
    The **internet** is a global computer network, a technical infrastructure that connects
    millions of computers around the world.
    While W3 is used to distribute data that contains links to other data, the Internet
    connects computers to each other to provide access to the information.
