    /*  The monthly payment for a given loan pays the principal and the interest. The monthly interest is computed by
        multiplying the monthly interest rate and the balance (the remaining principal). The principal paid for the
        month is therefore the monthly payment minus the monthly interest. Write a program that lets the user enter the
        loan amount, number of years, and interest rate then displays the amortization schedule for the loan.
