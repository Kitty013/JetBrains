/**
$1. Hello, World!
    Writing a program that displays a message "Hello, World!" on the screen or on
    another device.
    Here console.log is a function. A function is a block of code that performs useful
    work for you, such as printing text. In a way, a function is a subroutine that can
    be reused in your code.
**/
console.log("Hello, World!");

/**
$2. Explanation
    "Hello, World!" is a string. All strings in JavaScript are enclosed in single or
    double quotes, so 'Hello, World!' would also be a valid string.
**/
console.log('JavaScript');

/**
$3. Printing quotes
    If you want to include quotes in a string, there are two ways to avoid confusion
    and successfully print them:
**/
console.log("Yes, I'm ready to learn JS."); // quote this line in other types of quotes
console.log('Yes, I\'m ready to learn JS.'); // put a backslash before the quotation mark

/**
$4. Possible errors
    The most common errors are:
        - misprints
        - missing one or both quotation marks for a string
**/
