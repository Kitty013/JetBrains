    /*  Write a program that reads integers, finds the largest of them, and counts its occurrences. Assume the input
        ends with number0. Suppose you entered 3 5 2 5 5 5 0; the program finds that the largest is 5 and the occurrence
        count for 5 is 4.
        (Hint: Maintain two variables, max and count. max counts the current max number and count stores its occurrences.
        Initially, assign the first number to max and 1 to count. Compare each subsequent number with max. If the number
        is greater than max, assign it to max and reset count to 1; If the number is equal to max, increment count by 1.)
            Enter numbers: 3 5 2 5 5 5 0
            The largest number is 5
            The occurrence count of the largest number is 4
