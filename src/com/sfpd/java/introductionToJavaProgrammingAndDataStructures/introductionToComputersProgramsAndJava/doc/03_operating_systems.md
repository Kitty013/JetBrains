# Operating Systems
The operating system (OS) is the most important program that runs on a computer. The
OS manages and controls a computer's activities. Ex. Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, Linux.

The major tasks of an operating system are as follows:
* Controlling and monitoring system activities
* Allocating an assigning system resources
* Scheduling operations

## controlling and monitoring system activities
Operating systems perform basic tasks, such as recognizing input from the keyboard,
sending output to the monitor, keeping track of files and folders on storage devices,
and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.

## allocating and assigning system resources
The operating system is responsible for determining what computer resources a program
needs and for allocating and assigning them to run the program.
