# Identifiers 
Identifiers are the names that identify the elements such as classes, methods, and variables
in a program.

All identifiers must obey the following rules:
* An identifier is a sequence of characters that consists of letters, digits, underscores
  and dollar signs.
* An identifier must start with a letter, an underscore or a dollar sign. It cannot begin
  with a digit.
* An identifier cannot be a reserved word
* An identifier cannot be true, false or null.
* An identifier can be of any length.
